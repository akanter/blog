Aaron was born and raised in the birthplace of grunge, Seattle, Washington. He earned both his B.A. in Computer Science and B.M. in Classical Performance (Bass) from Oberlin College & Conservatory before moving to the San Francisco bay to pursue a career in technology.

He has a passion for tools and efficiency, helping himself and others to emphasize brain-work over grunt-work. You can find him at a prodigous amount of concerts and shows throughout the bay.
